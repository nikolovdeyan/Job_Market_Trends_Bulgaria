# Job Market Trends in Bulgaria

## Overview

This is a personal project to examine the employment market trends in Bulgaria based on data scraped from job postings scraped from large job portals. The main goal of the project is learning new tools for data wrangling and visualization. A secondary goal for the project is to be used as a tool for data-driven choice in employment opportunities.


The project will be organized as a series of articles offering a short analysis on a certain aspect of the job market with emphasis on the data presentation. Each of the produced visual elements (graphs, charts, themes, etc.) will also be documented for future reference in the form of a knowledge-base recipe.


The underlying data is not hosted within this repository.


## Articles

The first article published is concerned with the employment opportunities in the area of data analytics, data engineering, and data visualization.
